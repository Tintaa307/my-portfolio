              Hi, iÂ´m Valentin Gonzalez frontend developer very passionate and
              always looking to learn and improve. <br />
              <br />
              I'm 16 and my passion was always being able to develop
              applications or web pages. Although I love the frontend I started
              with the backend and then I found my passion in this area. <br />
              <br />I adapt very easily to tasks and I love working in a team
              and carrying out large projects.
            </p>
